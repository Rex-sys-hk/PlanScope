## Setup Environment

### Setup dataset

Setup the nuPlan dataset following the [offiical-doc](https://nuplan-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset_setup.html)

### Setup conda environment

```
conda create -n planscope python=3.9
conda activate planscope

# install nuplan-devkit
git clone https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit.git && cd nuplan-devkit
pip install -e .
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

# setup planscope
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/Rex-sys-hk/PlanScope && cd planscope
sh ./script/setup_env.sh
```

## Feature Cache

Preprocess the dataset to accelerate training. It is recommended to run a small sanity check to make sure everything is correctly setup.

```
 python run_training.py \
    py_func=cache +training=train_pluto \
    scenario_builder=nuplan_mini \
    cache.cache_path=/nuplan/exp/sanity_check \
    cache.cleanup_cache=true \
    scenario_filter=training_scenarios_tiny \
    worker=sequential
```

Then preprocess the whole nuPlan training set (this will take some time). You may need to change `cache.cache_path` to suit your condition

```
 export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)

 python run_training.py \
    py_func=cache +training=train_pluto \
    scenario_builder=nuplan \
    cache.cache_path=/nuplan/exp/cache_pluto_1M \
    cache.cleanup_cache=true \
    scenario_filter=training_scenarios_1M \
    worker.threads_per_node=40
```

## Training


```
sh train_scope.sh
```

- you can remove wandb related configurations if your prefer tensorboard.


## Checkpoint

Copy your the chekpoint path to ```sim_scope.sh``` or ```sim_pluto.sh``` and replace the value of ```CKPT_N``` to run the evaluation.

## Run PlanScope-planner simulation

Run simulation for a random scenario in the nuPlan-mini split

```
sh ./sim_scope.sh
```


## To Do

The code is under cleaning and will be released gradually.

- [ ] improve docs
- [x] training code
- [x] visualization
- [x] Scope-planner & checkpoint
- [x] feature builder & model
- [x] initial repo & paper

## Special Announcement

This work investigates a technique to enhance the performance of planning models in a pure learning framework. We have deliberately omitted the rule-based pre- and post-processing modules from the baseline approach to mitigate the impact of artificially crafted rules, as claimed in our paper. A certain unauthorized publication led to **inaccuracies in the depiction of its state-of-the-art (SOTA) capabilities**. We hereby clarify this to prevent misunderstanding.

Nevertheless, the method introduced in our article is worth trying and could potentially serve as an add-on to augment the performance of the models you are developing, especially when the dataset is small. We are open to sharing and discussing evaluation results to foster a collaborative exchange.
